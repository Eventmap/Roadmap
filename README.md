# Optime Roadmap

View the [Optime Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Eventmap/projects/43/views/2).

The Optime roadmap is where you can learn about what features we are working on and when we expect to make these available for general release.

## Disclaimer
This forward-looking product roadmap does not represent a commitment, guarantee or obligation to deliver any product feature by any particular date, and is intended to outline the general development plans for the Optime platform. It should be viewed as guidance for what we are hoping to achieve, and customers should not rely on this roadmap to make any purchasing decision. This roadmap will be updated as regularly as possible by the EventMAP development teams.
